    <!--  used when we want to send the data on server

    incase if you did not get the concepts here 
    let me clear it out 
    a fetch api returns a promise that resolves to response object 
    so if we use let p = await fetch(something ) the resolved value of fetch ,which is response object is stored inside the  p 
    and response object not only contains data but also information about the fetch request 
    so in oder to get access only to the data we have to use the response.json in the video harry is storing the response object in p so it will become p.json .p.json returns a proomise that resolves to the data we want to get from the server and harry is storing that data in response varible and then returning the response (data in this case )
    and whatever and async function returns is converted into a resolved value of a promise -->
